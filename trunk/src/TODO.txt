- Construct a file similar to cf_new.in.core.fasta and cf_new.in.corrected.fasta of length equal to the whole genome, but with non-core sites (i.e. sites with any Ns) padded entirely with Ns.
- ALTERNATIVELY, simply construct a FASTA file from the raw (filtered) calls of every genome, and allow the program to strip out sites with any Ns.
- ALTERNATIVELY AGAIN, allow the program to take a list of FASTA files (gzipped?) and read them directly?
- ALTERNATIVELY, give the program a list of sites to ignore

- Output reconstructed 
- Reduce memory reallocation during computation
- New function that does ancestral state reconstruction with two rates (unimported and imported) and corrected branch lengths
- Implement iterative refinement of ancestral states and inference of cross-species recombination/correction of branch lengths
- As a minimum, implement ancestral state reconstruction (for all sites?) using the corrected branch lengths
- Parallelize using OpenMP
- Implement quantification of uncertainty in reconstructed nucleotide and importation states via marginal probabilities

Implement command line options:
- List of sites to ignore (e.g. because they have been padded with invariant sites during pre-processing)
- Flag: ignore sites with any Ns? (default no)
- Flag: use multiallelic and homoplasious sites for ClonalFrame reconstruction? (default no)
- Flag: correct branch lengths for cross-species recombination? (default yes)
- Flag: report ancestral state reconstruction based on corrected branch lengths? (Or implied by correct branch lengths flag?)
- Flag: excess divergence model (default yes for 2 sequences only): in this model, the import_divergence augments the branch lengths instead of replacing it, ensuring cross-species recombination always increases expected divergence
- Tolerance for Powell and Brent ML algorithms
- Flag: output progress of ML algorithms to screen? (default no)
- Flag: compress ancestral state reconstruction output? (default yes)

Output files:
- Reconstructed ancestral (and imputed) sequences: FASTA format
- Reconstructed recombination status 0: unimported 1: imported 2: homoplasy ignored or unimported 3: homoplasy imported: FASTA format
- ClonalFrame tree with (possibly corrected) branch lengths and labelled nodes: Newick format
- Parameter estimates: to standard output
